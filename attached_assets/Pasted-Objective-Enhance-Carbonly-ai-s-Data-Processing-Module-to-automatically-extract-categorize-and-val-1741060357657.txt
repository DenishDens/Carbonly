Objective
Enhance Carbonly.ai‚Äôs Data Processing Module to automatically extract, categorize, and validate emissions data from various sources using AI, ensuring correct classification into Scope 1, Scope 2, or Scope 3. Additionally, implement a Material Library to allow users to add and manage materials with emission factors. AI will automatically map materials from invoices using name, code, and description matching. A filterable material list and notifications for unmatched materials will be included for user review.

üìÇ AI Workflow Integration
1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Ingestion
Sources
File Upload: Drag & Drop, CSV, PDF, Excel
Email Processing: Attachment Parsing
Third-Party Integrations: Xero, SAP, Pronto, MYOB, Google Drive, OneDrive, SharePoint
AI Actions
Extract raw text using OCR (for PDFs)
Parse structured data (CSV, Excel)
Identify key attributes:
Fuel Type
Distance
Material
Energy Usage
Store extracted data in a structured format for classification
2Ô∏è‚É£ AI-Powered Data Classification
Text Processing & NLP
Detect keywords related to emissions:
Fuel Consumption ‚Üí Scope 1
Electricity Usage ‚Üí Scope 2
Business Travel, Procurement ‚Üí Scope 3
Recognize activity units: (Liters, kWh, km, tons)
Convert currency & units to a standard format
Categorization Logic
If Fuel Consumption is detected ‚Üí Assign Scope 1
If Electricity Usage is detected ‚Üí Assign Scope 2
If Transport, Business Travel, or Purchased Goods is detected ‚Üí Assign Scope 3
If confidence score < 85%, flag for manual review
3Ô∏è‚É£ Auto-Populating the Data Table

4Ô∏è‚É£ Error Handling & User Validation
AI Flags Issues If:
Missing or ambiguous values
Unit conversion conflicts
Anomalies in emissions calculations (e.g., sudden spikes)
User Intervention
If AI confidence < 85%, prompt user for correction
Display flagged records in the UI with recommended actions
Allow manual overrides for incorrect categorization
5Ô∏è‚É£ Continuous Learning & Improvements
Store user corrections to refine AI classification
AI updates confidence thresholds dynamically based on feedback
Implement trend analysis to predict future emissions patterns
üìÇ AI-Powered Material Library
6Ô∏è‚É£ User-Managed Material Library
Location: Settings > Material Library
Fields:
Material Name (e.g., "BioDiesel B20")
Material Code (e.g., "BD20-001")
Description/Alternate Names (e.g., "Renewable Diesel, B20 Fuel Mix")
Emission Factor (kg CO‚ÇÇ/unit)
Unit Type (Liters, Tons, Cubic Meters, kg)
Supplier (Optional, if specific to a vendor)
Category (Fuel, Concrete, Steel, Chemicals, Plastics)
AI Indexing:
AI stores synonyms and variations to improve recognition.
7Ô∏è‚É£ AI Auto-Maps Materials from Uploaded Invoices
Data Extraction
AI scans invoice PDFs, CSVs, or Excel files using OCR and NLP.
Identifies Material Names, Codes, and Descriptions.
Matching Logic
Exact Match: AI finds the material using the Name or Code in the Material Library.
Smart Match: If an exact match is missing, AI checks synonyms in the Description field.
Fuzzy Matching: If AI detects a partial match (80%+ confidence), it auto-maps it.
User Review Required: If no match is found, AI flags it for manual confirmation and suggests the closest matches.
Emission Factor Application
Once a material is identified, AI applies the stored emission factor and calculates CO‚ÇÇe emissions.
8Ô∏è‚É£ User Review Notifications
If AI encounters an unknown material:
A notification appears in the top bar prompting user review.
Clicking the notification opens a review panel where users can:
Approve AI‚Äôs suggested match
Manually select a material from the library
Add a new material (AI learns for future mapping)
Bulk Review
Users can approve multiple flagged items at once.
AI learns from repeated corrections and improves mapping accuracy.
9Ô∏è‚É£ Filterable Material List
Location: Settings > Material Library > Material List
Table Columns:
Material Name
Material Code
Description
Emission Factor (kg CO‚ÇÇ/unit)
