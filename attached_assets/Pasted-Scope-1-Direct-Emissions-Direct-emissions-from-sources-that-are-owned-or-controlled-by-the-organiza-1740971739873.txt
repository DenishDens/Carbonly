Scope 1: Direct Emissions
Direct emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by the organization.

Subcategories:
Stationary Combustion:

Emissions from burning fuels in stationary equipment (e.g., boilers, furnaces, turbines).

Examples: Natural gas, coal, diesel, propane.

Mobile Combustion:

Emissions from vehicles owned or operated by the organization.

Examples: Cars, trucks, buses, airplanes, ships.

Process Emissions:

Emissions from chemical or physical processes.

Examples: Cement production, ammonia production, aluminum smelting.

Fugitive Emissions:

Unintentional leaks or releases of greenhouse gases.

Examples: Refrigerant leaks, methane leaks from pipelines.

Scope 2: Indirect Emissions from Purchased Energy
Emissions from the generation of electricity, steam, heating, or cooling purchased by the organization.

Subcategories:
Purchased Electricity:

Emissions from electricity consumed by the organization.

Examples: Grid electricity, renewable energy credits.

Purchased Steam:

Emissions from steam purchased for heating or industrial processes.

Purchased Heating/Cooling:

Emissions from district heating or cooling systems.

Scope 3: Other Indirect Emissions
All other indirect emissions that occur in the organization’s value chain, both upstream and downstream.

Subcategories:
Upstream Emissions:

Purchased Goods and Services:

Emissions from the production of goods and services purchased by the organization.

Examples: Raw materials, office supplies, IT services.

Capital Goods:

Emissions from the production of capital assets (e.g., machinery, buildings).

Fuel- and Energy-Related Activities:

Emissions from the extraction, production, and transportation of fuels and energy.

Examples: Well-to-tank emissions for fuels, transmission losses for electricity.

Upstream Transportation and Distribution:

Emissions from transporting goods to the organization.

Examples: Supplier logistics, third-party shipping.

Waste Generated in Operations:

Emissions from waste disposal (e.g., landfill, incineration).

Business Travel:

Emissions from employee travel for business purposes.

Examples: Air travel, train travel, car rentals.

Employee Commuting:

Emissions from employees commuting to and from work.

Examples: Personal cars, public transportation.

Upstream Leased Assets:

Emissions from assets leased by the organization (e.g., leased vehicles, buildings).

Downstream Emissions:

Downstream Transportation and Distribution:

Emissions from transporting sold products to customers.

Examples: Retail distribution, e-commerce shipping.

Processing of Sold Products:

Emissions from processing products sold by the organization.

Examples: Refining, manufacturing.

Use of Sold Products:

Emissions from the use of products sold by the organization.

Examples: Emissions from vehicles, appliances, or electronics.

End-of-Life Treatment of Sold Products:

Emissions from the disposal or recycling of sold products.

Examples: Landfill, incineration, recycling.

Downstream Leased Assets:

Emissions from assets leased to others (e.g., leased vehicles, buildings).

Franchises:

Emissions from franchise operations.

Investments:

Emissions from investments (e.g., equity, debt).
