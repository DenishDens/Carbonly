Dependencies: Business Units, Data Upload, AI Smart Mapping
✅ Why This is Needed?

The Material Library stores predefined emission factors for different materials.
Users can search, manage, and override emission values.
AI suggests emission factors for unknown materials.
Unit of Measure (UOM) enforcement ensures accurate calculations.
🔹 Objective:
💡 "Build a robust Material Library in Carbonly.ai that allows users to search, add, edit, and manage materials with predefined emission factors. AI should suggest missing values, and users should be able to override emission factors manually. Ensure that Unit of Measure (UOM) validation is enforced."

1️⃣ Material Library Core Features
✅ Database of Preloaded Materials & Emission Factors
✅ Allows Users to Manually Add Custom Materials
✅ AI-Suggested Emission Factors for Unknown Materials
✅ Unit of Measure (UOM) Enforcement
✅ Editable Emission Factors for Customization

2️⃣ Material Library Schema
✅ Each material must have:

Field Name	Type	Description
Material Name	Text	Fuel, Electricity, Concrete, Steel, etc.
Category	Dropdown	Fuel, Energy, Raw Material, Waste, etc.
Unit of Measure (UOM)	Dropdown	kg, liters, metric tons, kWh, m³, etc.
Emission Factor (CO₂e/unit)	Numeric	Default from regulatory databases but user can override
Source of Emission Factor	Dropdown	Default (Government/Industry Standard) or User-Defined
Last Updated Date	Auto	Tracks modification history
Approval Status	Dropdown	Pending / Approved (Admin & Business Unit Manager only)
3️⃣ Search, Filter & Sorting Features
✅ Users should be able to:

Search materials by name or category
Filter by material type (Fuel, Energy, Raw Material, etc.)
Sort by highest or lowest emission factor
View last updated date to track changes
✅ Auto-Suggestion for Material Matching

If a user adds a new material, AI should suggest a similar material from existing data.
If no match is found, AI should request user confirmation before assigning an emission factor.
4️⃣ AI-Driven Emission Factor Assignment
✅ AI Workflow for New Materials:
1️⃣ User adds a new material
2️⃣ AI searches existing database for similar materials
3️⃣ AI suggests closest match & recommended emission factor
4️⃣ User can accept or manually enter a new value
5️⃣ New material is stored & available for future use

✅ AI Smart Suggestions for Missing UOMs:

If a user selects a material but doesn’t choose a UOM, AI should auto-suggest one.
Example:
Diesel → Suggests Liters
Electricity → Suggests kWh
Cement → Suggests Metric Tons
5️⃣ User Roles & Permissions (RBAC)
✅ Who Can Manage the Material Library?

User Role	View	Edit	Approve New Materials
Admin	✅ Yes	✅ Yes	✅ Yes
Business Unit Manager	✅ Yes	✅ Yes	✅ Yes
Team Member	✅ Yes	❌ No	❌ No
Auditor	✅ Yes	❌ No	❌ No
6️⃣ Bulk Upload & Importing Materials
✅ Users must be able to upload a CSV file to bulk-import materials.

✅ CSV Format:

Material Name	Category	Unit of Measure (UOM)	Emission Factor (CO₂e/unit)	Source
Diesel	Fuel	Liters	2.68	Government Database
Natural Gas	Fuel	kWh	0.18	Industry Standard
Concrete	Raw Material	Metric Tons	0.13	User-Defined
✅ Bulk Upload Validation Rules:

Reject missing UOMs
Prompt AI to suggest emission factors for unknown materials
Flag inconsistencies for user review
7️⃣ AI Chatbot Integration (Floating Button)
✅ Users can ask:

"What is the emission factor for Diesel?"
"How much CO₂ is produced per ton of Cement?"
"Show me all materials under the Fuel category."
"What is the standard UOM for Natural Gas?"
"Can I override the default emission factor for my company?"
✅ AI Responses Should:

Fetch real-time emission factors from the database.
Provide source validation (government, industry, user-defined).
Allow users to override values (if permissions allow).
8️⃣ UI & User Experience
✅ Material Library Page Layout
📌 Main Features:

Search bar & filters
Material list table with sorting options
"Add New Material" button
Bulk Upload CSV option
AI-suggested materials for new entries
✅ Material Detail Page (Editable View)

Shows material properties (name, category, UOM, emission factor)
Edit emission factor (if role permits)
View material history & changes
✅ Data Validation Alerts

If UOM is missing, AI suggests one.
If a new material is added, AI tries to find a match.
Flag outdated emission factors for review.
