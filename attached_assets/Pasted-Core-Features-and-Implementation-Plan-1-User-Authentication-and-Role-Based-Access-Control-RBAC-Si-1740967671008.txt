Core Features and Implementation Plan
1. User Authentication and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Single Sign-On (SSO): Integrate with identity providers like Azure AD, Google Workspace, or Okta for seamless login.

Role-Based Access:

Admin: Full access to configure business units, targets, and compliance protocols.

User: Access to dashboard, data submission, and reports.

Auditor: Read-only access to verify data and compliance.

External Access: Allow auditors to log in with limited permissions to review data.

2. Dashboard
Overview: Display key metrics like total emissions, progress toward targets, and recent data updates.

Charts and Visualizations: Use libraries like D3.js or Chart.js for interactive graphs.

Notifications: Alerts for new data, target deviations, or compliance updates.

3. Business Unit Configuration
Business Unit Setup:

Allow admins to create and configure business units (e.g., departments, projects, locations).

Assign unique email addresses (e.g., project@carbonly.ai) for each unit to receive data.

Email Integration:

Use services like SendGrid or Amazon SES to handle incoming emails.

Parse email attachments (e.g., CSV, Excel) using AI for data extraction.

4. AI-Powered Data Processing
Data Ingestion:

Automatically detect and categorize data from emails or integrated drives (e.g., OneDrive, Google Drive).

Use AI models (e.g., NLP, computer vision) to extract and classify data (e.g., fuel usage, electricity consumption).

Reprocessing:

Allow users to reprocess individual transactions or entire datasets if errors are detected.

Natural Language Chat:

Integrate a chatbot (e.g., OpenAI GPT, Dialogflow) for users to query data, ask for insights, or get help.

Example: “What was our Scope 1 emissions last quarter?”

5. Target Configuration
Target Setting:

Allow admins to set targets at the business unit level or organization-wide.

Track progress in real-time and send alerts for deviations.

Predictive Analytics:

Use AI to predict future emissions based on historical data and trends.

Provide recommendations to stay on track with targets.

6. Integration with Cloud Storage
Folder Selection:

Allow users to select folders from OneDrive, Google Drive, or SharePoint.

Use APIs (e.g., Microsoft Graph, Google Drive API) to scan files and extract data.

Change Detection:

Monitor source files for changes (e.g., new rows in a spreadsheet).

Prompt users to rescan folders and accept updated data.

Data Sync:

Automatically sync data from cloud storage to the platform.

7. Finance System Integration
Direct Integration:

Integrate with accounting systems like Xero, MYOB, or SAP to pull financial data (e.g., fuel purchases, energy bills).

Email-Based Data Submission:

Allow users to forward financial data to a dedicated email address for processing.

Data Mapping:

Map financial data to emission categories using AI.

8. Compliance and Protocol Configuration
Org Settings:

Allow admins to configure compliance protocols (e.g., GHG Protocol, USA/Australian standards).

Automated Reporting:

Generate compliance reports based on the selected protocol.

9. Data Prediction and Insights
AI-Powered Predictions:

Use machine learning models (e.g., regression, time-series forecasting) to predict future emissions.

Actionable Insights:

Provide recommendations to reduce emissions (e.g., switch to renewable energy, optimize logistics).

Technical Stack
Frontend: React.js or Angular for a responsive and interactive UI.

Backend: Node.js or Python (Django/Flask) for API development.

Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB for structured and unstructured data storage.

AI/ML: Python with libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or OpenAI for NLP and predictive analytics.

Cloud Storage Integration: Use APIs for OneDrive, Google Drive, and SharePoint.

Finance System Integration: Use APIs for Xero, MYOB, and SAP.

Email Processing: Use services like SendGrid or Amazon SES.

SSO: Integrate with Azure AD, Google Workspace, or Okta.

Workflow Example
User Logs In: Authenticate via SSO and access the dashboard.

Configure Business Unit: Admin sets up a new unit and receives a dedicated email address.

Submit Data: Users forward data to the email address or select a folder from cloud storage.

AI Processes Data: AI extracts, categorizes, and inserts data into the system.

Review and Reprocess: Users can review and reprocess data if needed.

Set Targets: Admin configures emission targets for the organization or specific units.

Generate Reports: Automatically generate compliance reports based on configured protocols.

Auditor Access: External auditors log in to verify data and compliance.

Challenges and Considerations
Data Security: Ensure data encryption and compliance with GDPR or other regulations.

Scalability: Design the system to handle large datasets and multiple integrations.

AI Accuracy: Continuously train AI models to improve data extraction and prediction accuracy.

User Experience: Keep the interface intuitive and user-friendly.

This architecture and feature set will create a robust, scalable, and user-friendly platform for carbon emissions tracking and management.
