Key Principles for the UI
Categorization by Scope: Organize data into Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 for clarity.

Dynamic Data Handling: Allow users to view and manage any type of emissions data (e.g., fuel, electricity, travel, waste).

Unified Dashboard: Provide a single view for all processed data with filters, visualizations, and actions.

Flexible Data Display: Use a combination of tables, charts, and cards to display data in a meaningful way.

Actionable Insights: Highlight key metrics, trends, and anomalies for quick decision-making.

UI Layout for All Scopes and Data Types
1. File Upload Section
Upload Button: Allow users to upload files (e.g., CSV, Excel).

Drag-and-Drop Area: Support drag-and-drop for multiple files.

Supported Formats: Display supported formats (e.g., CSV, XLSX, JSON).

Progress Indicator: Show a progress bar or spinner during processing.

2. Processed Data Overview
Scope-Based Tabs:

Use tabs for Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3.

Each tab displays a summary of processed data for that scope.

Summary Cards:

Show key metrics for each scope (e.g., total emissions, number of records, data sources).

Example:

Scope 1: "15 records processed | Total Emissions: 1,200 kg CO2e."

Scope 2: "10 records processed | Total Emissions: 800 kg CO2e."

Scope 3: "25 records processed | Total Emissions: 2,500 kg CO2e."

3. Data Display by Scope
Dynamic Table:

Display all processed data in a sortable, filterable table.

Columns: Date, Category (e.g., Fuel, Electricity, Travel), Quantity, Unit, Emissions (CO2e), Source, Status.

Allow users to edit or reprocess individual rows.

Filters:

Add filters for Date Range, Category, Source, and Status.

Search Bar:

Allow users to search for specific entries (e.g., by Category or Date).

4. Visualizations
Scope-Wise Charts:

Show a bar chart for emissions breakdown by category (e.g., Fuel, Electricity, Travel).

Show a line chart for emissions trends over time.

Pie Chart:

Display the proportion of emissions by scope (Scope 1, Scope 2, Scope 3).

Emissions Heatmap:

Show emissions intensity by month or category.

5. Data Actions
Reprocess Button:

Allow users to reprocess the entire file or selected rows.

Export Button:

Export data as CSV, Excel, or PDF.

Delete Button:

Remove incorrect or unwanted data.

6. Notifications and Alerts
Success Message:

Display a confirmation message after successful processing (e.g., "25 records processed successfully").

Error Handling:

Highlight rows with errors (e.g., missing data, incorrect format) and provide suggestions for correction.

Change Detection:

If the source file is updated, prompt the user to rescan and accept changes.

Example UI Flow
Step 1: File Upload
User lands on the Upload Page.

Drags and drops a file or clicks "Upload."

Sees a progress bar while the file is processed.

Step 2: Processed Data Overview
After processing, the user is redirected to the Processed Data Page.

Sees summary cards for each scope (e.g., Scope 1: 15 records, Scope 2: 10 records, Scope 3: 25 records).

Categorized tabs appear: Scope 1, Scope 2, Scope 3.

Step 3: Data Display by Scope
User clicks the Scope 1 tab.

Sees a table with Scope 1 data (e.g., Fuel, Company Vehicles).

Uses filters to view specific data (e.g., Diesel only).

Edits a row if necessary.

Step 4: Visualizations
User views a bar chart showing emissions breakdown by category (e.g., Fuel, Electricity).

Sees a line chart showing emissions trends over time.

Views a pie chart showing the proportion of emissions by scope.

Step 5: Actions
User exports the data as CSV.

Reprocesses the file to correct errors.
